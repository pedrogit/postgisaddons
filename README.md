PostGIS PL/pgSQL Add-ons - Readme
http://github.com/pedrogit/postgisaddons

The PostGIS Add-ons attempt to gather, in a single .sql file, useful and 
generic user contributed PL/pgSQL functions and to provide a fast and Agile 
release cycle.

A quick description of every new function can be found at the beginning of the
postgis_addons.sql file. A detailed description precede each function definition.
